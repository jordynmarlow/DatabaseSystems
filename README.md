# DatabaseSystems

This is a group project for CS-461 at Kettering University. 
Our task was to create software to manage a library's books. This program allows for multiple users: Members, Librarians, and Admins. Their permissions are:
- Members: browse all books in the library and view the books they have cheched out
- Librarians: brows all books in the library, check a book in/out for a member
- Admin: brows all books in the library, check a book in/out for a member, create accounts for new users<br/><br/>

## How to Run

Must have Python 3.8 or above and PyQt5.
